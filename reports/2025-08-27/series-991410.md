# Executive Brief: BorrowedPage, AsPageIter and VmallocPageIter

**Status**: Ready for merge  
**Significance**: Infrastructure

## What & Why

This patchset introduces infrastructure for safely iterating over pages backing vmalloc allocations in Rust code. It provides a `BorrowedPage` type (for non-owning page references), an `AsPageIter` trait (common interface for page iteration), and `VmallocPageIter` (specific iterator for vmalloc-backed memory). This enables Rust drivers to work with scatter-gather lists and DMA operations that need to access individual pages of large allocations.

## Technical Context

The kernel's vmalloc allocator provides virtually contiguous memory that may be physically scattered across multiple pages. Unlike kmalloc (which provides physically contiguous memory), vmalloc is used for larger allocations where physical contiguity isn't required. For DMA operations and scatter-gather lists, drivers need to iterate over the individual backing pages.

The C kernel provides `vmalloc_to_page()` to convert virtual addresses within vmalloc regions to their backing `struct page` pointers. This patchset wraps that functionality safely in Rust, ensuring proper lifetime management and preventing use-after-free bugs that are common in C drivers dealing with page references.

The `BorrowedPage` abstraction is particularly important because it provides non-owning access to pages (the vmalloc allocation retains ownership), which is the correct semantic for this use case. This avoids the complexity of transferring page ownership while still enabling safe iteration.

The implementation is mature (v4) with strong community endorsement from key Rust-for-Linux maintainers (Alice Ryhl, Alexandre Courbot) and shows 13 days of stable development without significant issues. This represents solid infrastructure work that unblocks driver development requiring page-level memory management.
