# Executive Brief: `Zeroable` improvements & bindings integration

**Status**: Under review  
**Significance**: Infrastructure

## What & Why
This patchset modernizes Rust-for-Linux zero-initialization by automatically deriving the `Zeroable` trait for C struct bindings and replacing unsafe manual zero-initialization with type-safe alternatives. It eliminates a class of undefined behavior bugs while improving ergonomics for kernel developers working with C FFI structures.

## Technical Context
The kernel frequently needs zero-initialized structures for C API interop (device registration, hardware configuration, etc.). Previously, developers used unsafe patterns like `MaybeUninit::zeroed().assume_init()` or `core::mem::zeroed()`, which can trigger undefined behavior if applied to types with invalid zero representations.

This series:
- Extends bindgen to automatically derive `Zeroable` for generated C bindings where safe
- Adds `pin-init` dependency to bindings modules to enable `pin_init::zeroed()`
- Migrates existing unsafe zero-initialization in miscdevice, PHY, and block subsystems

The approach leverages Rust's type system to prevent UB at compile-time rather than relying on developer discipline. Bindgen's analysis ensures `Zeroable` is only derived for types where zero-initialization is actually safe.

## Issues & Conflicts
No technical concerns evident. The 13-day silence with no reviewer feedback suggests either the changes are uncontroversial or may need maintainer attention to drive review process. This is foundational safety infrastructure that likely benefits from explicit review by subsystem maintainers.
