# Executive Brief: rust: lib: add if_cfg! macro for conditional compilation

**Status**: Quality concerns  
**Significance**: Incremental improvement

## What & Why

This patch introduces an `if_cfg!` macro to simplify conditional compilation in Rust kernel code, allowing developers to write compile-time branches based on kernel configuration options (like CONFIG_64BIT). The macro provides a more ergonomic alternative to manually writing paired `#[cfg]` and `#[cfg(not())]` attributes for conditional code paths.

## Technical Context

The macro addresses a common pattern in kernel development where code needs to compile differently based on kernel configuration. Instead of duplicating conditional compilation boilerplate, developers can use `if_cfg!(if CONFIG_64BIT { 64-bit code } else { 32-bit code })`. This mirrors similar functionality available in userspace Rust but adapted for kernel configuration attributes.

The implementation generates the traditional `#[cfg(condition)]` and `#[cfg(not(condition))]` attribute pairs that the Rust compiler expects, maintaining compatibility with existing kernel build infrastructure while providing cleaner source code.

## Issues & Conflicts

**Technical concerns raised by reviewers:**
- Thomas Wei√üschuh questioned whether this duplicates existing `cfg!()` macro functionality, suggesting the standard library approach may be sufficient
- The discussion reveals incomplete technical justification for why a new macro is needed versus existing solutions

**Process issues:**
- Greg KH flagged formatting problems (trailing whitespace, From: line mismatch)
- Author used top-posting instead of inline responses, indicating unfamiliarity with kernel development conventions
- No maintainer endorsements after 13 days suggests limited community buy-in

**Quality indicators:** Single v1 patch with process violations and unresolved technical questions indicates this needs significant rework before consideration.
