# Executive Brief: mm: rust: add page.rs to MEMORY MANAGEMENT - RUST

**Status**: Ready for merge  
**Significance**: Infrastructure

## What & Why

This is a simple MAINTAINERS file update that adds existing Rust memory management code (`page.rs` and related helpers) to the official MEMORY MANAGEMENT - RUST maintainer entry. The code was previously added for Rust Binder but wasn't formally tracked under any maintainer section, creating a gap in oversight and responsibility.

## Technical Context

The `page.rs` module provides Rust abstractions for Linux kernel page management - a fundamental part of the memory management subsystem that handles physical memory allocation and tracking. This code bridges between the kernel's C-based page structures and Rust's type safety guarantees, allowing Rust drivers to safely manipulate memory pages without direct unsafe operations.

The patch adds two files to the maintainer scope:
- `rust/kernel/page.rs` - Safe Rust abstractions for kernel page structures
- `rust/helpers/page.c` - C helper functions that interface between Rust and kernel page APIs

Alice Ryhl (Google) is already the maintainer for MEMORY MANAGEMENT - RUST, with Lorenzo Stoakes and Liam Howlett from Oracle as reviewers. Both Oracle reviewers have acked this change, indicating alignment within the MM subsystem community.

## Stakeholder Summary

This represents mature infrastructure development - Rust memory management abstractions that have moved from experimental (Binder driver) to reusable components (upcoming scatterlist work). The clean acks from established MM maintainers demonstrate growing acceptance of Rust in core kernel subsystems.
