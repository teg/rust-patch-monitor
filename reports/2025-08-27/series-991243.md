# Executive Brief: rust/hrtimer: Various hrtimer + time additions

**Status**: Mature/stable  
**Significance**: Incremental improvement

## What & Why
This v7 patchset adds Rust bindings for high-resolution timer (hrtimer) functionality, specifically timer forwarding operations and callback context handling. It enables Rust kernel code to manage precise timing operations that are critical for drivers and subsystems requiring sub-jiffy precision, advancing the completeness of Rust's kernel API coverage.

## Technical Context
High-resolution timers are Linux's mechanism for microsecond/nanosecond precision timing, essential for hardware drivers, media subsystems, and real-time operations. The kernel's hrtimer API has context-sensitive safety requirements - certain operations like `hrtimer_forward()` can only be called either when holding exclusive timer access or from within the timer's callback context.

This patchset addresses these safety constraints through Rust's type system by:
- Adding `HrTimerInstant` for precise time representation
- Creating `HrTimerCallbackContext` that provides compile-time guarantees about callback execution context
- Implementing both raw and safe variants of forward operations (`raw_forward()`, `forward()`, `forward_now()`)
- Ensuring API safety through context-aware type design rather than runtime checks

The implementation maintains zero-cost abstractions while preventing misuse that could cause kernel instability. This represents solid incremental progress in making kernel timing primitives safely accessible to Rust code.

## Issues & Conflicts
The patchset shows healthy maturity at v7 with minimal recent discussion and maintainer reviews from Andreas Hindborg and Daniel Almeida. No technical concerns or blocking issues are evident. The 13-day age with stable endorsements suggests this is ready for integration pending maintainer bandwidth.
