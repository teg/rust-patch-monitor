# Executive Brief: rust: dma: Update ARef and AlwaysRefCounted imports from sync::aref

**Status**: Ready for merge  
**Significance**: Infrastructure

## What & Why

This patch updates import paths in the DMA subsystem to use `ARef` and `AlwaysRefCounted` from their new location in `sync::aref` instead of `types`. This is part of a broader reorganization to improve the Rust-for-Linux API structure and make reference counting primitives more discoverable in their logical location within the synchronization module.

## Technical Context

The DMA (Direct Memory Access) subsystem in Rust-for-Linux provides safe abstractions for kernel DMA operations, which are critical for device drivers that need to transfer data directly between devices and memory without CPU intervention. `ARef` (atomic reference) and `AlwaysRefCounted` are fundamental primitives for memory safety in this context, ensuring proper lifetime management of DMA buffers and related structures.

This change reflects the maturation of Rust-for-Linux's API organization - moving core synchronization primitives like reference counting into a dedicated `sync` module rather than the general `types` module. The patch was applied immediately by the subsystem maintainer (Danilo Krummrich), indicating this is part of an accepted architectural direction tracked in GitHub issue #1173.
